1. Set up Docker on your machine and start it

2. Navigate to github_flask_app folder and locate docker-compose.yml file

3. Start the container using following command which creates network "github_flask_app_default" with the default driver, installs required packages, runs tests and builds api-service
$ docker-compose up

4. Check process status of Docker, confirm IMAGE: github_flask_app_api-service is up and running
$ docker ps -a

If successful, your server is ready, or else rebuild the image using either of the following commands and check the status of processes running
$ docker-compose build
or
$ docker-compose up --build
